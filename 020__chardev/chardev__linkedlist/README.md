# Hello Interrupt Module - Customized Workqueue Demo

The source was tested compiled and running on 5.4.75.  


## Usage

```
$ make
$ sudo insmod ./linkedlist.ko

$ echo 7 | sudo tee -a /dev/lothars_device
    7

$ sudo cat /dev/lothars_device

$ echo 456 | sudo tee -a /dev/lothars_device
    456

$ sudo cat /dev/lothars_device

$ echo asdf | sudo tee -a /dev/lothars_device
    asdf
    tee: /dev/lothars_device: Invalid argument

$ sudo cat /dev/lothars_device

$ sudo rmmod linkedlist

## Notes

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes. Each node is composed of two fields: the data field and the reference field which is a pointer that points to the next node in the sequence.  

Advantages of Linked Lists  

 * They are dynamic in nature which allocates the memory when required.
 * Insertion and deletion operations can be easily implemented.
 * Stacks and queues can be easily executed.
 * Linked List reduces the access time.

Disadvantages of Linked Lists  

 * The memory is wasted as pointers require extra memory for storage.
 * No element can be accessed randomly; it has to access each node sequentially.
 * Reverse Traversing is difficult in the linked list.

The linux kernel has built-in Linked List which are **Double Linked List** defined in ``/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/include/linux/list.h``
