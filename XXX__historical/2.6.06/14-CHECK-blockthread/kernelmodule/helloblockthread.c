  demonstrates setting a thread to sleep
TODO: there are still some things unclear here... will see later 
though it compiles and uses the proc, also via the client


  "void" declaration for empty function parameters necessary
  to avoid warnings!

  "static" declaration for variables and functions necessary 
  to avoid namespace conflicts with other functions by the same 
  name (in same "common" namespace!).

  init_module(void) and cleanup_module(void) implementations 
  must not have "static" return types!

  C90 conformity: declarations of variables have to be made at 
  begin of each block (a function body is a block!)

  declaration follows the C90 standard

      two unsigned longs. We now have to make 2 checks in our if.

      Nobody promised me they'll never use more than 64 bits, or that this book

      code would work in any case.
