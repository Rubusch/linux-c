// helloioctl.h
/*
  the declarations here have to be in a header file, because
  they need to be known both to the kernel module (in chardev.c)
  and the process calling ioctl (ioctl.c)

  "void" declaration for empty function parameters necessary
  to avoid warnings!

  "static" declaration for variables and functions necessary 
  to avoid namespace conflicts with other functions by the same 
  name (in same "common" namespace!).

  init_module(void) and cleanup_module(void) implementations 
  must not have "static" return types!

  C90 conformity: declarations of variables have to be made at 
  begin of each block (a function body is a block!)

  declaration follows the C90 standard
