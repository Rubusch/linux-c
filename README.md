# Lothar's Kernel Codes

No guarantees! Use the code snippets at your own risk.  

Many codes or ideas are literature examples or found on the web. I
tried to provide references for the examples to my best understanding.  

From what I took as notes - from what I learned, the reader may find
here my personal collection of kernel codes.  

The verification platform is RPi 3b, 64-bit.  

Sunshine!
