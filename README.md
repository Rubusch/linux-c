# Lothar's Kernel Codes

[Hardware](./pics/screenshot01.jpg)  

No guarantees! Use the code snippets at your own risk.  

This is my collection of kernel code snippets. Demos and codes I did, assembled, or adjusted from literature directly, or reimplemented by the idea. I tried to provide references for documentation and resources to the best of my knowledge.  

Note: **The verification platform is RPi 3b**, 32 or 64-bit, in some cases x86 (64-bit).  

_Let us be thankful we have commerce. Buy more. Buy more now. Buy. And be happy._
