/*

  - A userspace application connects to this module (chardev driver)
    via device_ioctl() and writes the signal number which the
    application is capable to serve.

  - A separate trigger via 'cat /dev/lothars_device'
    i.e. device_read() will then issue the passed signal number
    (SIG_LOTHAR) to the userspace application.

  - The userspace application has a signal handler which captures the
    signal and performs the action (quits itself).

  - The device_release() will cleanup the signal handling together
    with the chardev itself.

  NB: Generally, this is usefull in an approach to register an
  userspace application via ioctl, but then e.g. in an interrupt
  handler issue the signal (as kind of an interrupt) to notify the
  userspace application.

  The problem in this for a demo is how to simulate hardware
  interrupts without the need to rebuild the entire kernel and export
  internal vector_irq lists or such..

  Hence, this awkward solution here to issue a Signal on a read
  chardev.
