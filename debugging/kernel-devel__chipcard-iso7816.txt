STANDARDs

there are different typs of chipcards, pure memory cards up to processor cards
all cards have a Card Operating System (COS) with proprietary commands
standard regulates Answer to Reset (ATR) and Protocol and Parameter Setting (PPS), commands then depend on the card

contactless chipcards:
iso14443 contactless chipcards (RFID)

PROTOCOL

asynchronous chipcards
 - no separate clock line
 - IO line signal is clocked by sender
 - each participant has his own clock
 - start bit, stop bit and wait/guard bits required:
    <start + 8 data bits + stop + parity + wait>
 - robust, i.e. tolerates <5% deviation of the clock rate
 - slow, due to additional bits
 - in case UART support
 - one bit takes 372 ticks, this is 1 Elementary Time Unit (ETU)


synchronous chipcards
 - separate clock line
 - IO line signal is clocked by clock line
 - each participant shares the clock signal of the clock line
 - no start, stop, wait is needed:
     <8 data bits>
 - not so robust, does not tolerate much deviation to the clock signal
 - fast, due to less overhead bits
 - probably rather bitbanging
 - one bit takes one tick





CONTACTS

    VCC  GND
    RST  VPP (opt)
    CLK  I/O
    NC   NC

VCC - enable, power..
GND - ground
RST - reset
VPP - optional, not needed
CLK - clock
I/O - in- and output
