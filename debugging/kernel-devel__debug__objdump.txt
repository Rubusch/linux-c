USAGE


debug a kernel module

without debug symbols, you will see the assembler code for the routine shown,
but if your kernel has debug symbols the C code will also be available

$ objdump -r -S -l --disassemble net/dccp/ipv4.o




debug the kernel

objdump -dS vmlinux > /tmp/kernel.s

Open the generated assembly file, /tmp/kernel.s. with a text editor such as vim.
Go to unwind_backtrace+0x0/0xf8, i.e. search for the address of
unwind_backtrace + the offset. Finally, you have located the problematic part in
your source code.
