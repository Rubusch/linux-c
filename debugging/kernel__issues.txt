kernel 6.1:
issue: interrupt implementation uses "irq_to_desc()"
    ERROR: modpost: "irq_to_desc"

fix/notes: irq should not carry any pointer information
irq_to_desc() should not be needed, a "hack"/alternative might be irq_data_to_desc()

ref: https://github.com/gschorcht/spi-ch341-usb/issues/18 
    Around line 796, there's irq_to_desc which shouldn't be used in a module. afaik, it's for kernel use only.
    See https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-rdma/patch/20201210194045.551428291@linutronix.de/
    Kernel 5.10 and on won't export irq_to_desc any longer. As mentioned, it is to stop the abuse of it.
    
    From now on this usage will only result in an undefined error:
    ERROR: modpost: "irq_to_desc" [/home/sysghost/Sources/spi-ch341-usb/spi-ch341-usb.ko] undefined!
