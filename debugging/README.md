# My Notes on Debugging

This is my scratchpad, some notes I took during the past years
- Incomplete descriptions
- Fixes or workarounds in quite particular situations
- Copy & paste fragments, snippets,... from the kernel documentation
  (often also outdated or incomplete)

NB: I do not really manage this colection. Always when I have a look into it,
it feels like rewriting ;)
