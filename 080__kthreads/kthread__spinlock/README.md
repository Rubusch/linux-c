The source was tested compiled and running on 5.4.75.  


## Usage

```

## Notes

The demo shows elementary usage of spinlocks.  

If the kernel is running on a uniprocessor and CONFIG_SMP, CONFIG_PREEMPT arenâ€™t enabled while compiling the kernel then spinlock will not be available. Because there is no reason to have a lock when no one else can run at the same time.  

#### Locking between User Contexts or between Bottom Halves

 * ``spin_lock(spinlock_t *lock)``
 * ``spin_trylock(spinlock_t *lock)``
 * ``spin_unlock(spinlock_t *lock)``
 * ``spin_is_locked(spinlock_t *lock)``

#### Locking between User Context and Bottom Halves

E.g. inside thread routine and tasklet function use:  

 * ``spin_lock_bh(spinlock_t *lock)``
 * ``spin_unlock_bh(spinlock_t *lock)``

#### Locking between Hard IRQ and Bottom Halves, Locking between Hard IRQs

E.g. inside irq handler and tasklet function use:  

 * ``spin_lock_irq(spinlock_t *lock)``
 * ``spin_unlock_irq(spinlock_t *lock)``
 * ``spin_lock_irqsave(spinlock_t *lock, unsigned long flags)``
 * ``spin_unlock_irqrestore(spinlock_t *lock, unsigned long flags)``
