pr_debug()

RESOURCE
https://www.kernel.org/doc/local/pr_debug.txt



USAGE

Some files call pr_debug(), which is ordinarily an empty macro that discards
its arguments at compile time.  To enable debugging output, build the
appropriate file with -DDEBUG by adding

    CFLAGS_[filename].o := -DDEBUG

to the Makefile.





EXAMPLE

For example, to see all attempts to spawn a usermode helper (such as
/sbin/hotplug), add to lib/Makefile the line:

    CFLAGS_kobject_uevent.o := -DDEBUG

Then boot the new kernel, do something that spawns a usermode helper, and
use the "dmesg" command to view the pr_debug() output.
