STACK_CHECK_MAX_FRAME_SIZE - The maximum size of a stack frame, in bytes. GNU CC
will generate probe instructions in non-leaf functions to ensure at least this
many bytes of stack are available. If a stack frame is larger than this size,
stack checking will not be reliable and GNU CC will issue a warning. The default
is chosen so that GNU CC only generates one instruction on most systems. You
should normally not change the default value of this macro.


Possible solutions would include
- passing a compiler flag to relax the warning,
- expand the upper limit of the stack size, or
- dynamically allocating the buffer - the actual recommended fix!

ignore the warning and simply turn it off:
    #pragma GCC diagnostic push
    #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wframe-larger-than="

        ...
    #pragma GCC diagnostic pop
