# Character Device Driver

The loadable kernel module, tested on 5.4.75.  

## Usage
```
$ make
$ sudo insmod chardev.ko
$ dmesg
    (...)
    [198458.510364] I was assigned major number 244.
    [198458.510365] To talk to the device, create a dev file with
    [198458.510366] 'sudo mknod /dev/lothars_char_dev c 244 0'
    (...)
$ sudo mknod /dev/lothars_char_dev c 244 0

// FIXME: /dev/lothars_char_dev not writeable                  
$ echo "hi" > /dev/lothars_char_dev
$ cat /dev/lothars_char_dev
```

Additionally it creates an entry in `/proc/devices`  


## Implementation

 1. Define the specific functions and define a file_operations structure and set the funcions to be used for which operation.  

 2. Define and implement each operation for reading from user space to kernel space use put_user  

NB: Init_module(void) and exit_module(void) implementations must not have "static" return types!  

C90 conformity: declarations of variables have to be made at begin of each block (a function body is a block!)
