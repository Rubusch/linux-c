# pwm dummy

The demo does not have hardware set up. Thus it just compiles a dummy pwm.  

## Usage

-> NO USAGE, just code snipped. It compiles, but is not configured to use hwardware. Usually this would require to setup something like a `platform_device`. Hook this up by a `probe()` to the DT. Then configure a pwm and binding to this driver.
